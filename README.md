# AutoFill Application
The purpose of this project is to plan and build an Autofill Search Bar for various types of fruit. The main objective being that when you type anything, a drop down appears with suggestions for what you may want to search for. If you click on one of these suggestions, the search bar should be autopopulated with that suggestion.
